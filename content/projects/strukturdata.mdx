# Youtube Channel Crawling Using Python
This project is the final project of the data structure course where I crawl from YouTube to get various data from a video on a particular channel.

## The data I took from the Channel is as follows:
- Video Title
- Video Id
- Publish Date
- Video Views
- Video Likes
- Like Percentage
- Comment Count
- Comment Percentage


The data obtained will be used for further analysis process related to comments on the video.
