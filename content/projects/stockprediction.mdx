# Project Overview
A CLI application that applies machine learning using python to perform future predictions related to stock prices.
In this project I use data from bitcoin to predict future prices for x days. X is the variable number of days to be predicted and this variable is input by the user through the CLI and will be modeled using the Linear Regression algorithm from Python.

After making a model using the Linear Regression algorithm, the next process will be to visualize the prediction results using the matplotlib library, and if the user has comparative data such as the original price from the next few months, a visualization will be carried out that compares the prediction results and the original price, so that it can be seen the comparison of the original price and the predicted price.

All the processes that have been mentioned are found in the CLI when the user runs the main.py file.
