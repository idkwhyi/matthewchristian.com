# Simple CRUD Implementation Using Express.JS and MongoDB

This project is a simple implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using **Express.js** as the backend framework and **MongoDB** as the database. The project is designed to process data efficiently, with REST API endpoints that allow data management such as adding, reading, updating, and deleting entries. Suitable as a foundation for Node.js-based web applications.

This project is an exercise I used to learn and understand the basic concepts of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in backend development. Built using **Express.js** as the backend framework and **MongoDB** as the database, this project helped me learn how to create and manage REST API endpoints for data management. This is my first step in strengthening my understanding of Node.js-based web application development.
