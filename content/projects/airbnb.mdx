# React Clone Airbnb (Old UI) 
This project is a personal project that I created by following the react tutorial for beginners from FreeCodeCamp on youtube.
By following the tutorial, I understand more about the process of creating a website in React.JS.

This project is only the frontend of the react Airbnb website without implementing the backend.

## Things I Learn From This Project
Some of the basic react logic that I learned from this tutorial process is as follows:
- React useState
- React Component Mapping
- Component folder structure in React.JS
- Tailwind CSS Syntax
